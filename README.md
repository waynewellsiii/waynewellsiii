Hello (world 🌍) and welcome! <- haha get it. funny programmer joke :) 

Thank you for visiting my git hub profile. I am @waynewellsiii.
I am a big fan of documentation so hopefully everything the code here is up to those standards. (Please feel free to add more when it isn't 👍)

Blitz of information about me:
- I’m interested in how non-computer people interact with the software that I make.
- I’m currently learning how to write "good" code. Really, something that I am satisfied with until I can think of a better way to do it in a couple of months. 
- I do most of my current work with pure JS.
- I would love to write something that others find useful, just as others have done for me. 
- I LOVE learning foreign languages a long with programming languages.
- How to reach me email: waynewellsiii@gmail.com, or most other socials with the same @.
